## Problem 1 

Phone Directory is a web application that allows a user to manage contacts.
Once a contact is saved, it appears in a table.
The list can be sorted by name.
The list can be filtered by phone number

## Problem 2
Using this API and the functional programming style of array operations, provide
code to solve for the problems below. You MUST USE this FP style with
functions such as map, reduce, filter, flatmap and so on. If you find yourself
using loops, youâ€™re doing it wrong. Carefully think through which data
transformations you need to apply in which order in your pipeline.
For each answer, use console.log() to display the data (i.e. you do not
have to build DOM objects):
1. List all of the post titles having more than six words

2. Show a word frequency map for all of the body contents of the post
